#### Presentation in a Box .. You'll love this!

### /// You’re Awesome!

Are you passionate about mobile and want to spread your excitement about the Telerik Platform?  We’re here to help and appreciate your awesomeness!

### /// What’s in the Box?

This is a "presentation in a box". The idea is that you'll find everything you need for presentations of any size or shape.  Here’s what you’ll find in our GitHub Repo – use it all or just pick the pieces you need:

* Guides – Let us provide some presentation pointers; you can also roll on your own
* Slide Decks – HTML5 web-based, PDFs or PowerPoints to suit your needs
* Demos – Selected showcase apps for easy presentations in your chosen IDE

### /// 20 Minute Cameo

If you have a short amount of time to do a lightning talk on x-plat hybrid mobile development and Telerik AppBuilder, here’s what we think are the most important points to cover:

* Quickly explain mobile strategies (mobile web, native or hybrid)
* Explain where Telerik AppBuilder fits with hybrid mobile development
* Showcase tooling through flexibility of IDEs
* Stick to the slide decks entirely and walk through options
* Cover In-browser client, (Pick One: CLI, Sublime Text, Visual Studio) IDE integration
* Show quick build/deployment using Companion app and QR code scanner
* Mention Plugins Marketplace
* Highlight flexibility and wrap-up

### /// 25-60 Minute Presentation

Ah, the comfort zone of a regular User Group or Conference session! Here’s what might make sense:

* Start with mobile strategies (mobile web, native or hybrid)
* Emphasize where hybrid approach makes sense
* Explain roots of Apache Cordova and what PhoneGap means
* Show the gaps and then introduce Telerik AppBuilder
* Stress on flexibility of IDEs and build/deploy ease
* Run through the deck fully or feel free to jump out to show & tell
* Demo In-browser client with project creation through templates
* Show In-browser simulators
* Demo adaptive rendering with Kendo UI Mobile
* Create same project with OSX/Windows CLI and launch native simulators
* Open CLI-created project with Sublime Text to show integration
* Go back to In-browser to demo builds
* Walk-through Companion app deployment through QR code scanning
* Mention app package deployments and device/provisioning setups
* Show Bower integration & package management
* Walkthrough Visual Studio integration and native Windows simulators
* Show Plugins Marketplace and show integration in IDEs
* Highlight flexibility of tooling & wrap up

### /// Got more than an Hour?
Whoah .. that’s some serious talking time! Take your time to run through the deck & showcase all the IDEs. You could use one or more of the demos as starting point for some hands-on workshop time. Alternatively, please feel free to ping any of the Telerik DevRel advocates – it’s what we do.

### /// Have fun
Hopefully, you enjoy building cross platfrom hybrid mobile apps as much as we do and see where Telerik AppBuilder provides all the tooling needed for success. We hope this content allows you to share the love! Got something cool to contribute back? We love it – just submit a pull request or fork the slides.com presentations and we'll take a look.
